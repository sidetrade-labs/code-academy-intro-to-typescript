### Use template

Once you've registered, you should be able to click the "Use Template" button.

When you click this, you should be able to name your repository and create your own copy.

### Opening with Gitpod

Gitpod builds you a development environment right in your browser so that we don't need to setup and install all the differenet components/parts of a toolkit that a developer may need. It helps to make this part as accessible as possible so that we don't have to worry different laptop setups & installation problems, all you need is Google Chrome, a Chrome Extension & a GitHub account.
